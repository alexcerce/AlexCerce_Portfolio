## [Investigating the Rise of Airbnb in Berlin](https://github.com/alexcerce/Berlin_Airbnb)
  In the summer of 2018 I spent the summer studying in Berlin and learning about past and current issues.
  One of the largest modern issues in Berlin, is the rise of Airbnb. Many expats moving to Berlin struggle
  to find apartments, a large part of this issue has been due to the rise of Airbnb. Many apartment owners have realized
  how much more money they can make off Airbnb in comparison to the cheaper long-term rental prices.
  To investigate this, I am utilizing data scrapped directly from airbnb as part of the [Inside Airbnb Project](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
  With this data, I have built visualizations and prediction models to better understand key factors
  in the rise of Airbnb.
  
  This project includes:
  * Collecting data from multiple tables
  * Extensive cleaning
  * Building visualizations to better understand the situation
  * Developing a basic pricing model to give new Airbnb users the optimal listing price for their apartment
